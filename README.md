# Sudoku Solver

If you are completely new to open source, take a look at these to get started.

- [Codesis-yellow-pages](https://github.com/The-Codesis/codesis-yellow-pages/blob/master/README.md)
- [Simple-static-website](https://github.com/The-Codesis/simple-static-website/blob/master/README.md)

Now you are good to go !

# Setup the Project

- **Fork** and then **clone** the project (Refer to the former links if you are confused)

## Install OpenCV

Follow this tutorial carefully at [pyimagesearch.com](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/09/19/pip-install-opencv/)

## Install Tensorflow 2.0

Make sure you are on the same virtual environment in which you installed OpenCV

Tensorflow 2.0 comes with keras already, so you don't need to install it. 

Follow this tutorial [Install tensorflow 2.0](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2019/12/09/how-to-install-tensorflow-2-0-on-ubuntu/). 

Setting up Tensorflow 2.0 for GPU is a little tricky, so you can skip doing that to avoid difficulties in getting started.

## Install other Requirements

Go to the folder where you cloned the project

```
cd sudoku_solver
```

**Install the requirements from requirements.txt**

- Switch to you virtual environment

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Make a new branch for development and Get Started

```
git checkout -b <issue-name__or__feature-name>
```

Follow the README.md [Codesis simple static website](https://github.com/The-Codesis/simple-static-website/blob/master/README.md) and [Codesis Yellow Pages](https://github.com/The-Codesis/codesis-yellow-pages/blob/master/README.md) if you are completely new to working on github.

Start working on the issue. Cheers !
